Acute mesenteric ischaemia
	* Pneumatosis portalis (gas in portal vein/ mesenteric vein)
	* Pneumatosis intestinalis (@decreased bowel wall integrity)





Classifications:
	acute superior mesenteric artery occlusion
	acute superior mesenteric vein occlusion
	small bowel ischaemia
	large bowel ischaemia (ischaemic colitis)
	small bowel obstruction
	chronic intestinal ischaemia

How to image:
	CT (multiple phase
		non contrast
		arterial phase (aortic >100 HU)
		portal venous phase 
		)
	CT has replaced prev gold standard catheter angiography



Articles:

ACUTE Small bowel (mesenteric ischaemia)
	occlusive
		superior mesenteric artery occlusion (66% of cases)
		superior mesenteric vein occlusion 

	non-occlusive (shocked bowel)
		systemic hypotension
		blunt abdominal trauma
		medication induced vasoconstriction

	small vessel involvement
		vasculitis (RARE)
		acute radiation enteritis
		chemotherapy induced enteropathy

	small bowel obstruction
		eg herniation/ adhesion etc. causes ischaemic bowel @increased diameter == ++wall tension == resistance to blood flow. 


	:: Pneumatosis portalis - gas in the portal/ mesenteric veins due to 



CHRONIC Small bowel (chronic mesenteric ischaemia)
	
	@atherosclerotic occlusion of the SMA == mesenteric angina esp post meals. 

	chronic radiation enteritis
