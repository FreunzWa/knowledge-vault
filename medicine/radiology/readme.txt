Area: Medicine/ radiology
Goal: Be really good at radiology signs, recognising a pathology from a given image. 
-----------

Follows the structure in the notes:

Pathology : Findings

specifically, 
	Pathology:
		Fingdings on plain film
		Findings on USS
		findings on CT
		findings on MRI
		etc.

images are more important here than literally anywhere else.
break into pathology groups, like in the pathology section, 
and in within each have a txt file for the findings together
with the images for a given pathology.
