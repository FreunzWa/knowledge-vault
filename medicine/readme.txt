Area: Medicine
Goal: File system for easy note-taking in medicine, requires support for images and searching by keyword. Should also have a review schedule that specifies when given material should be revisited to ensure retention.
----------------------
Parts:
- Clinical medicine: Focus on presentation, clinical diagnosis with physical examination, logic behind choosing given investigations, structures for approaching clinical setting. Management
- Pathology: Detail into mechanisms, diagnostic pathology behind disease processes. Also focusses on diagnostic modalities.
- Diagnostics: Fundametals behind diagnositc modalities, how they work etc.
- Radiology: Diagnostic radiology all in one area. Big attention on radiological features characteristic of underlying pathology. Structure is disease:findings. Eg @renal calculi ureteric obstruction == %hydronephrosis/ ureteric dilatation. If the findings have names associated, best to use these. Strongly suggest syncing with anki as well.
- Intervention: Eg pharmacological , surgical etc. How they work, side effects, adverse reactions etc.
