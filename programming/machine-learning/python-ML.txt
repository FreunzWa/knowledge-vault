modules/ packages for machine learning
	
	Keras
		sequential model:
			a linear stack of neural nertwork layers, good for building 
			CNNs

		Core layers:
			Dense, drouput, activation, flatten
				layers used in almost every neural network

		convolutional layers to help with image data
			Convolution2D, MaxPooling2D


	Theano
		module for evaluating matrix data

		must preprocess data to specify a depth channel



Pre-processing data for machine learning
		normalise values between 0-1
