Introduction:


Basics
	learn from data to make decision/ predcitions
	identify patterns without explicit programming


GLOSSARY
	Deep learning
		refers to neural networks with multiple hidden layers
		that incresasinly abstract representation of the input
		data.
		eg, as data is fed through each layer patterns emerge, eg
			edges on an object, ==> more and more specific


	Convolutatiional neural networks
		multi-layer nerual networks that assume the input data to be images



	supervised vs unsupervised learning
		supervised is the most common type of algorithm for learning

		supervised 
			a dataset is provided in which the correct choice/ decisions
			data is given to teh machine. in this way the system can 
			learn from incorrect decisions and refine weightings as 
			a result.

	other types of learning algorithms:
		reinforcement learning/ recommender systems.






Programming lanagues

	sklearn (gold standard python lib for general purpsoe machine learning)

	R: caret (for R)









GOALS:


Try to solve projects:
	Titanic survivor prediction

Write an algorithm from scratch
