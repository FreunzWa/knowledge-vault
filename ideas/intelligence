Intelligence:

Intelligence is a derived quantification of an individual's capacity
to solve problems/ creativity/ ingenuity etc.
- I believe that intelligence comprises a combination of 2 primary other
parameters regarding capacity:
	1) 'Smartness'
	2) Knowledge

i.e.
	Intelligence ~ Smartness * Knowledge (or some related equation)

Of these, only one can reliably be improved during the course of one's life, the other (the former - 'smartness') cannot be improved largely past
a certain point in life - a certain age threshold which is somewhat variable. 

The determinants of "smartness"
===============================
i believe that the parameter which i have chosen to label as 'smartness' is
a largely inherent quality that is relatively static during the course of life. 
what determines the degree to which someone can be considered 'smart'?

1) Genetics (smart parents beget smart children)
2) Health in utero + early development (epigenome, nutrition hypothesis)
3) Early education
	acts synergistically with the genetics component.
	education can be in the form of encouraging an inquisitive mind
	in the young developing child, reading to the child, surrounding
	the child with curious objects, exposure to complex music, etc.

The aforementioned 'threshold' can be seen to be highly variable, but probably in most children falls around the age of 4-6. After this point, 
there is very little which can be done to influence 'smartness'.

~~The prodigy:

Prodigies who exhibit precocious talents in very specific fields likely have high
helpings of 'smartness', but potentially not substantially more than 
another intelligent individual who peaks in there 20s, say. I believe, that the inherent smartness of both groups will be determined around the same stage, 
but other personality traits likely not embroiled in the equation of intelligence (for instance focus / attention etc.) predispose prodigies
to greater rates of the acquisition of knowledge. 
Take the example of the chess prodigy. These undeniably genius children
have truly large complements of "smartness", but equally important to 
their status of chess prodigy is the knowledge parameter. Their ability
to play at the highest level of competition is predicated on acquiring
a vast number of experiences in the form of playing a vast number of 
games. The degree to which a chess prodigy will have to grind to gain
masterful insight into the games is inversely proportional to how smart they
are. The smartest will be able to pick chess up quickly and play at a high
level with a relatively smaller number of games under their belt. 


Knowledge
===========

Very labile, knowledge can easily change vastly during the course of ones life. Learning and education are obvious determinants, but unfortunately again smartness becomes a limiting factor, as likely the determination of knowledge has smartness somewhere as an accelerant in its derivation. 
Smarter individual will be able to construct scenarios in which their 
learnign willl be more efficient, and thus the rates of acquisition of 
knowledge will become proportionately higher. 
Despite this, knowledgecan be improved in any individual of course, and 
as such any individual can become more intelligent, without becoming
'smarter'.
