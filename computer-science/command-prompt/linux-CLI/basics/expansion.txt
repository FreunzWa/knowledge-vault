arithmetic expansion

	arithmetic expansion uses the form:

	$((expression))
		where expression is an arithmetic expression consiting of values and arithemetic operators. 


brace expansion
	
	multiple text strings crated from a pattern containing braces
	most common application is to make list of files/ directories to be created
	eg
		echo {Z..A}{A..Z}
			will print out all two letter combinations

		echo {A,B,C}hello
			will print out Ahello, Bhello, Chello


			
quotes
	double quotes
		place text inside quotes, all special cahracters within lose the special meaning, treated as normal chars.
			this does not extend to $, /, `, which have special meanings
			within strings. 

		eg useful for referring to filenames that have spaces. 

		however, expansion still occurs in double quotes (including
		parameter expansion and arithmetic expansion)

		word splitting is suppressed, embedded space not treated as delimitiers, becoming themselves part of the argument. 

	single quotes
		using single quotes supppresses ALL expansions. 

	\
		the escape backslash character suppresses a given expansion
		in double quotes
		suppress characters that would usually have a special meaning
		to the shell (eg |)
		can also be used to insert special characters into the text
