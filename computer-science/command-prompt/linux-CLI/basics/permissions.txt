computer can have multiple user supported by the OS
eg. whilst using the computer others can access teh computer via
a secure shell (ssh) and operate hte computer. esp Unix systems. 
originally unix designed to serve multiple / many users at the same time.

on linux, each file and dir is assingedd access rights for the own er  fo the file. rights can be assigned to read a file/ write/ execute file. to see permission settings, use ls command. 



FILE PERMISSIONS
-------------------
permission lsting format in ls

-rwxrwxrwx

first(rwx) specifies file owner permissions (read/write/execute)
2nd rwx specifies pemissions for group owner of file
3rd rwx specifies permissions for all other users

binary conversion

-111000000 (700), for 3 digit binary conversions
only the file owner can read write or execute the file



DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS
-------------------------
same octal notation pattern, but attributes different

r
	allows contents to be listed if x is also set
x
