==========

KERNEL
	computer program at core of operating system, controls everything in the system. 
	most systems, one of first programs loaded after the bootloader

	handles rest of start up after bootloader, and input/output requests
	from software, communicates with devices, memory, CPU. 

	kernel code loaded into separate area of emmory insulated from 
	other programs. "kernel space"
	system call is made when a process makes a request to the kernel.

	CPU:
		kernel decides when the many running programs should be allocated
		to the processors
	RAM:
		RAM used to store program instructions + data, both need to 
		be present for program to execute. 
	I/O devices
		allocates requests from applciations to peform IO to an appropriate device and provides methods (aPI) for the device.


BOOTLOADER
	@computer powered of, software remains stored in non volateile memory, including
	the operating system. 

	@powered on == small program in read only memory (ROM), to load the OS
	and other related software and data from non volatile memory
	this "small program" is the bootstrap loader (aka bootstrap or bootloader), the only job of this program is to load other
	data and programs into RAM, and then execute them.
